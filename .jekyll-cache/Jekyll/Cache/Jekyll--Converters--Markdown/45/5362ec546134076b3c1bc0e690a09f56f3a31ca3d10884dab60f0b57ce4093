I"›<p>Conferences are a perfect way to make friends and learn from experts. Here are some React conferences to look forward to in 2018.</p>

<p>Jekyll uses a language called <strong>Markdown</strong> to format text.</p>

<p>When you go to edit a post and see special characters and colours intertwined between the words, those are Markdown shortcuts which tell Ghost what to do with the words in your document. The biggest benefit of Markdown is that you can quickly apply formatting as you type, without needing to pause.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the editor, youâ€™ll find a toolbar with basic formatting options to help you get started as easily as possible. Youâ€™ll also notice that thereâ€™s a <strong>?</strong> icon, which contains more advanced shortcuts.</p>

<p>For now, though, letâ€™s run you through some of the basics. Youâ€™ll want to make sure youâ€™re editing this post in order to see all the Markdown weâ€™ve used.</p>

<h2 id="formatting-text">Formatting text</h2>

<p>The most common shortcuts are of course, <strong>bold</strong> text, <em>italic</em> text, and <a href="https://example.com">hyperlinks</a>. These generally make up the bulk of any document. You can type the characters out, but you can also use keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CMD/Ctrl + B</code> for Bold</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CMD/Ctrl + I</code> for Italic</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CMD/Ctrl + K</code> for a Link</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CMD/Ctrl + H</code> for a Heading (Press multiple times for h2/h3/h4/etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>With just a couple of extra characters here and there, youâ€™re well on your way to creating a beautifully formatted story.</p>

<h2 id="inserting-images">Inserting images</h2>

<p>Images in Markdown look just the same as links, except theyâ€™re prefixed with an exclamation mark, like this:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">![Image description](/path/to/image.jpg)</code></p>

<p><img src="https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/computer.jpg#wide" alt="Computer" /></p>

<h2 id="making-lists">Making lists</h2>

<p>Lists in HTML are a formatting nightmare, but in Markdown they become an absolute breeze with just a couple of characters and a bit of smart automation. For numbered lists, just write out the numbers. For bullet lists, just use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code>. Like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Crack the eggs over a bowl</li>
  <li>Whisk them together</li>
  <li>Make an omelette</li>
</ol>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remember to buy milk</li>
  <li>Feed the cat</li>
  <li>Come up with idea for next story</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="adding-quotes">Adding quotes</h2>

<p>When you want to pull out a particularly good excerpt in the middle of a piece, you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code> at the beginning of a paragraph to turn it into a Blockquote. You mightâ€™ve seen this formatting before in email clients.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A well placed quote guides a reader through a story, helping them to understand the most important points being made</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All themes handles blockquotes slightly differently. Sometimes theyâ€™ll look better kept shorter, while other times you can quote fairly hefty amounts of text and get away with it. Generally, the safest option is to use blockquotes sparingly.</p>

<h2 id="dividing-things-up">Dividing things up</h2>

<p>If youâ€™re writing a piece in parts and you just feel like you need to divide a couple of sections distinctly from each other, a horizontal rule might be just what you need. Dropping <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">---</code> on a new line will create a sleek divider, anywhere you want it.</p>
