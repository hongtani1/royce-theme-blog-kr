I"Ë<p>A blockchain, originally block chain, is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. By design, a blockchain is inherently resistant to modification of the data. It is <em>‚Äúan open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way‚Äù</em>.</p>
